# cue vs skillport — Claude Code skill manager comparison

_Last updated: 2026-05-24_

**Short answer:** [skillport](https://github.com/search?q=skillport) is a skill installer — it pulls SKILL.md files from a registry into your `~/.claude/skills/` directory. [cue](https://github.com/opencue/claude-code-skills) is an agent profile manager — it scopes skills + MCPs + plugins + persona + playbooks + quality gates per-directory, with inheritance, materialized isolation, and a failure-feedback loop.

Pick **skillport** if you want a Homebrew-for-Claude-Code skill index. Pick **cue** if you want per-project agent loadouts that compose into expert agents.

## When to pick each

### Pick skillport if

- You want a single global skill library and don't care about per-project isolation
- You're a solo developer with one project type
- You don't need MCP server, plugin, or hook management

### Pick cue if

- You work on multiple projects with different domains (backend repo + frontend repo + marketing site)
- You want different agent loadouts per directory (cybersecurity here, marketing there)
- You care about per-message token cost — every skill loaded globally adds ~$0.10–$0.30/session
- You use multiple coding agents (Cursor at work, Claude Code at home, Codex in CI)
- You want your agents to follow protocols + meet quality bars, not just have tools

## Migrating from skillport to cue

If you already use skillport, your existing `~/.claude/skills/` directory survives — cue's resolver looks there too. To bring those skills under cue's profile system:

```bash
# 1. Install cue
npm install -g cue-ai

# 2. Scaffold a profile from what's already installed
cue init   # scans ~/.claude/skills/ + your repo, suggests a profile

# 3. Pin the profile to your project
cd ~/projects/my-repo
echo my-profile > .cue-profile

# 4. Test
claude   # boots with just my-profile's skills, instead of all of them
```

You don't lose access to the global skills — they're still there. cue just scopes which ones are loaded per directory.
