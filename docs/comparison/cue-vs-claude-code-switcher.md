# cue vs claude-code-switcher — Claude Code MCP / config switcher comparison

_Last updated: 2026-05-24_

**Short answer:** `claude-code-switcher` swaps between named MCP configurations — useful if you keep separate sets of MCP servers for different projects. [cue](https://github.com/opencue/claude-code-skills) does that **plus** skills, plugins, rules, commands, hooks, persona, playbooks, quality gates, and evals — a full per-directory agent loadout, not just an MCP set.

Pick **claude-code-switcher** if your only need is "different MCPs per project." Pick **cue** if you also want different skills, plugins, persona, and quality gates per project — without manual switching.

## When to pick each

### Pick claude-code-switcher if

- You explicitly want to swap MCP sets and *only* MCP sets, manually
- You don't have skills or plugins you want to scope per-project
- You prefer minimal tooling — one tiny script

### Pick cue if

- You want **automatic switching by directory** instead of running `switch` every time you `cd`
- You want to scope **skills + plugins + hooks + persona**, not just MCPs
- You want your agent to **inherit a common baseline** across projects (claude-mem, common rules, safety hooks) and only diverge where needed
- You want **token-cost reduction** — cue's per-profile isolation cuts context by 10–25×

## Migrating from claude-code-switcher to cue

Your existing named configs map to cue profiles:

```bash
# 1. Install cue
npm install -g cue-ai

# 2. For each named config you have, create a matching profile
cue new my-backend       # scaffolds profiles/my-backend/profile.yaml
cue new my-frontend
# ...

# 3. Move your MCP server list into each profile.yaml under mcps:
# (cue resolves MCP IDs against resources/mcps/configs/)

# 4. Pin profiles to directories
cd ~/repos/backend  && echo my-backend  > .cue-profile
cd ~/repos/frontend && echo my-frontend > .cue-profile

# Now `claude` in each repo automatically picks the right loadout — no switch command needed
```
