# awesome-list submissions

Highest ROI of any growth task. Each PR is durable inbound traffic for years.

## Target lists (in priority order)

| Repo | Section to add cue under | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code` | Tools / CLI utilities | flagship list for Claude Code community |
| `arashpiya/awesome-mcp-servers` | "Tools / managers" | cue manages MCP servers; fits |
| `punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers` | "Skills / profile managers" | mirror of arashpiya, different audience |
| `koodemo/awesome-ai-agents` | "Agent frameworks / tooling" | broader audience |
| `agen-tic-ai/awesome-claude` | "Tooling" | smaller list but cleaner SEO |
| `langgptai/awesome-llm-prompt-engineering` | "Tools / utilities" | adjacent audience |
| `kuwl0/awesome-cli-apps` | "Development / package managers" | general dev audience, broader reach |
| `agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps` | "Development / Tools" | classic awesome-cli list |
| `anthropics/cookbook` | (PR a notebook example using cue) | longshot but cited heavily |

## The canonical entry to paste

Keep it under 200 chars. The recipe most awesome-lists follow:

```markdown
- [cue](https://github.com/opencue/claude-code-skills) — Agent profile manager for Claude Code, Codex, and 10+ AI coding agents. Discover, install, and organize skills, MCPs, and plugins per-project. [![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/opencue/claude-code-skills?style=social)](https://github.com/opencue/claude-code-skills)
```

Variant emphasizing **discovery** (for awesome-mcp-servers):

```markdown
- [cue](https://github.com/opencue/claude-code-skills) — Discover MCP servers + skills via GitHub Code Search, score by quality signal, install into per-profile bundles. CLI, MIT-licensed. [![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/opencue/claude-code-skills?style=social)](https://github.com/opencue/claude-code-skills)
```

Variant for **CLI tools** lists:

```markdown
- [cue](https://github.com/opencue/claude-code-skills) `npm install -g cue-ai` — Profile manager + skill discovery for AI coding agents. One CLI, 10+ agents, automatic per-project profile resolution.
```

## Workflow per list

```bash
# 1. Fork the list
gh repo fork hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code --clone --remote

# 2. Branch + edit
cd awesome-claude-code
git checkout -b add-cue-profile-manager
# (edit README.md — paste the entry under the right section, keep alphabetical order if the list demands it)

# 3. Commit + push
git commit -am "Add cue — profile manager for Claude Code and 10+ AI agents"
git push origin add-cue-profile-manager

# 4. Open PR
gh pr create --fill --title "Add cue — profile manager for Claude Code" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
**Project**: [cue](https://github.com/opencue/claude-code-skills)
**License**: MIT
**Stars**: see badge
**What it does**: Manages Claude Code / Codex profiles. Each profile bundles skills, MCPs, plugins, rules, and slash commands. cue auto-resolves the right profile per cwd and materializes a per-profile CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR so the agent only loads what the current task needs.
**Discovery side**: includes `cue discover` which scans GitHub Code Search for high-quality skill repos, scores them, and bundles them per-profile.

Happy to address any feedback. Thanks for maintaining this list.

## Common pitfalls

- **Sort order**: most awesome lists are alphabetical within sections. Insert at the right spot or maintainer will ask you to.
- **Badge spam**: don't add 3 badges. One stars badge max.
- **Quality bar**: lists like `awesome-claude-code` reject low-quality entries. Make sure the repo has: ✅ README screenshot, ✅ working demo, ✅ ≥10 stars, ✅ last commit <30 days. If any is missing, fix first.
- **Don't bulk-submit**: 1 PR per list per session. Reviewers see bulk submissions and reject as spam.
